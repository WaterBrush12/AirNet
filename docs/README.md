Trying to solve air pollution problems with minimum resources
---
## My Background

As someone born in Tehran, the capital city of Iran, I've lived with the health and frustration
of extreme air pollution. As of right now, 4th of June 2025, Tehran is the 4th most air polluted
city in the entire world! I remember times where school, and sometimes even offices would be closed
just because of the sheer amount of the air pollution that existed.

- The microcontroller code for the sensors, data logging and the air purifying system.
- Cost breakdown and list of material providers
- Documentation on my stidues about air pollution
- Documentation on the building process (log)

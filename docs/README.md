Trying to solve air pollution problems with minimum resources.


## My Background

As someone born in Tehran, the capital city of Iran, I've lived with the health and frustration  
of extreme air pollution. As of June 4, 2025, Tehran is the **4th most air-polluted**  
city in the entire world. I remember times when schools — and even offices — would close  
because of the sheer amount of pollution in the air.


## My Goal

Build a low-cost, scalable, and open-source air quality monitoring and purifying system.


## What's Included in This Repository

- Hardware blueprints and schematics  
- Microcontroller code for the sensors, data logging, and purification system  
- Cost breakdown and list of material providers  
- Documentation on my research into air pollution  
- A log documenting the full building process  
- Real photos of prototypes and deployed units

## What Exactly is Air Pollution?

Air pollution is the presence of harmful substances in the atmosphere -- such as particulate matter, gases, or chemichals -- that degrade air quality and pose risks to human health. ecosystems, and the climate.

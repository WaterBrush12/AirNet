Trying to solve air pollution problems with minimum resources.


## My Background

As someone born in Tehran, the capital city of Iran, I've lived with the health and frustration  
of extreme air pollution. As of June 4, 2025, Tehran is the **4th most air-polluted**  
city in the entire world. I remember times when schools — and even offices — would close  
because of the sheer amount of pollution in the air.


## My Goal

Build a low-cost, scalable, and open-source air quality monitoring and purifying system.


## What's Included in This Repository

- Hardware blueprints and schematics  
- Microcontroller code for the sensors, data logging, and purification system  
- Cost breakdown and list of material providers  
- Documentation on my research into air pollution  
- A log documenting the full building process  
- Real photos of prototypes and deployed units

## What Exactly is Air Pollution?

Air pollution is the presence of harmful substances in the air, such as gases,
particles, and biological molecules, that can harm human health and the environment.
It is caused by sources like vehicle emissions, industrial processes, burning fossil fuels,
and natural events like wildfires. These pollutants can lead to respiratory diseases,
environmental damage, and climate change. Controlling air pollution is essential for public 
health and ecological balance.

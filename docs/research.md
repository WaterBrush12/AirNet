## An Overview of Air Pollution

Definition in the oxford dictionary:  
> The presence in or introcudtion into the air of a substance which has harmful or poisinous effects.

The "World Health Organization" (WHO) characterizes Air Pollution as the contamination of the indoor or outdoor entironment by any chemical, physical or biological agent that
modifies the natural characteristics of the atmosphese. This definition expands the original oxford explination by adding biohazards to the equation as well.  
They go on and provide us with some common examples which include but are not limited to: Household combustion devices, motor vehicles, industrial facilities and forest fires. Afterwards the major public health concern is clarified, which are: **particulate matter**, **carbon monoxide**, **ozone**, **nitrogen dioxide** and **sulfur dioxide**. Both outfoor and indoor air pollution can cause serious respiratory and other diseases.

WHO data also shows that almost (99%) of the global population is breathing air which exceeds [WHO guideline limits](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240034228) and there are high levels of pollutants present in our air. Another unfortunate aspect is that low- and middle-income countries are suffering the most and have the highest exposoures.

The air quality is also very closely linked to earth's ever-warming climate, due to many of the drivers of air pollution, for example the combustion of fossil fuels, are also huge sources of greenhouse gas emissions.

AirNet will be focusing on the indoor aspect of air pollution and the health of people. It will be presenting ideas and prototypes to reduce the pollutants in our air and will also have a critical focus on the financial aspect of filtering the air so that executing the idea in low- and middle-income countries will be even more attractive to their governments.

## Types of Pollutants

Pollutants Which AirNet will be focusing on are:

- Particulate matter (PM)
- Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)
- Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)
- Ozone (O3)
- Carbon monoxide (CO)

### Particulate Matter

Particualte matter (PM) are particles which are composed of sulphate, nitrates, ammonia, sodium chloride, black carbon, mineral dust, or water. It can be categorized into 2 categories based on their aerodynamic diameter: <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;"> PM2.5 </span> and <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;"> PM10 </span>, with PM2.5 meaning that the diameter of the particle is less or equal to 2.5 μm and PM10 refering to particles with the diameter of 10 or less μm.

The largest particles are called "coarse particles" and mainly constist of pollen, sea spray, and the windblown dust from erosion, agricultural spaces, roadway and mining operations. The finer particles (PM2.5) can be derived from primary sources, like burning fossil fuel in power generation facilities or motor vehicles, and secondary sources, e.g. chemical reactions between gases.

The greates source of PM around the home is the combustion of polluting fuels (which can also come into the home from outside), inefficient stoves or space heaters. Other household activites such as preparing animal fodder, heating water et cetera can also contribute to the amount of PM indoors.

The health risks of PM2.5 and PM10 are especially well documented and can be viewed [here](https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/health-and-environmental-effects-particulate-matter-pm).

### Volatile Organic Compounds

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are compounds that have a high vapor pressure and low water solubility. Many of these VOCs are made by humans. They are chemicals that are used and produced in the manufacture of paints, pharmeceuticals, and refrigerants. VOCs are usually industrial solvants, such as *trichlorothylene*, *fuel oxygenates* (e.g. MTBE); or they are by-products produced by chlorination in water treatment, such as chloroform. They are  also often a part of petroleum fuels, hydraulic fluids, pain thinners, and dry cleaning agents. VOCs are common ground-water contaminents as well, but AirNet will **not** be covering water related matter.

### Nitrogen Dioxide

Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a reddish-brown gas that is soluble in water, and is a strong oxidant. Common sources of this gas come from high temperature combustion of fuels in processes like heating, transportation, and power generation. Household sources of nitrogen oxides (NOx) include equipment that burns fuel like furnaces, fireplaces and gas ovens. Exposure to NO2 can cause irritation in the airways and aggressive respiratory diseases.  
NO2 is an important ozone precursor, a pollutant closely linked to asthma and other respiratory conditions.

### Ozone

Ozone (O3) is a major  component of smog (smoke fog). It is formed from photochemical reactions with pollutants such as VOCs, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides emmited from vehicles, and industry. It is most predominantly seen during periods of sunne weather, due to its photochemical nature. Ozone can also be generated by household equipment such as portable air cleaners.  
Exposure to **exessive** amounts of ozone can lead to breathing problems, trigger asthma, reduce lung function, and lung disease.

You can find out more about O3 [here](https://www.epa.gov/ground-level-ozone-pollution)

### Carbon Monoxide

Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odourless gas created by the incomplete combustion of carbonaceous fuels such as wood, petrol, coal, natural gas, and kerosene, usually burned in stoves, open fires, wick lamps, furnaces, et cetera. The most predominant source of CO in ambiant air is from fuel combustion in motor vehicles.  
CO diffuses across the lung tissues and into the bloodstream, making it difficult for the body's cells to bind to oxygen. The lack of oxygen can lead to the deteriation of cells. Symptoms of carbon monoxide exposure include but are not limited to: exhaustion, dizziness, difficulty breathing, et cetera. Exposure to high levels of this gas can be deadly.

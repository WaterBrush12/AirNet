## An Overview of Air Pollution

Definition in the oxford dictionary:  
> The presence in or introcudtion into the air of a substance which has harmful or poisinous effects.

The "World Health Organization" (WHO) characterizes Air Pollution as the contamination of the indoor or outdoor entironment by any chemical, physical or biological agent that
modifies the natural characteristics of the atmosphese. This definition expands the original oxford explination by adding biohazards to the equation as well.  
They go on and provide us with some common examples which include but are not limited to: Household combustion devices, motor vehicles, industrial facilities and forest fires. Afterwards the major public health concern is clarified, which are: **particulate matter**, **carbon monoxide**, **ozone**, **nitrogen dioxide** and **sulfur dioxide**. Both outfoor and indoor air pollution can cause serious respiratory and other diseases.

WHO data also shows that almost (99%) of the global population is breathing air which exceeds [WHO guideline limits](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240034228) and there are high levels of pollutants present in our air. Another unfortunate aspect is that low- and middle-income countries are suffering the most and have the highest exposoures.

The air quality is also very closely linked to earth's ever-warming climate, due to many of the drivers of air pollution, for example the combustion of fossil fuels, are also huge sources of greenhouse gas emissions.

AirNet will be focusing **more** on the indoor aspect of air pollution and the health of people. It will be presenting ideas and prototypes to detect the pollutants in our air and will also have a critical focus on the financial aspect of detecting air pollution so that executing the idea in low- and middle-income countries will be even more attractive to their governments.

## Types of Pollutants

Pollutants Which AirNet will be focusing on are:

- Particulate matter (PM)
- Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)
- Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)
- Ozone (O3)
- Carbon monoxide (CO)

### Particulate Matter

Particualte matter (PM) are particles which are composed of sulphate, nitrates, ammonia, sodium chloride, black carbon, mineral dust, or water. It can be categorized into 2 categories based on their aerodynamic diameter: <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;"> PM2.5 </span> and <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;"> PM10 </span>, with PM2.5 meaning that the diameter of the particle is less or equal to 2.5 μm and PM10 refering to particles with the diameter of 10 or less μm.

The largest particles are called "coarse particles" and mainly constist of pollen, sea spray, and the windblown dust from erosion, agricultural spaces, roadway and mining operations. The finer particles (PM2.5) can be derived from primary sources, like burning fossil fuel in power generation facilities or motor vehicles, and secondary sources, e.g. chemical reactions between gases.

The greates source of PM around the home is the combustion of polluting fuels (which can also come into the home from outside), inefficient stoves or space heaters. Other household activites such as preparing animal fodder, heating water et cetera can also contribute to the amount of PM indoors.

The health risks of PM2.5 and PM10 are especially well documented and can be viewed [here](https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/health-and-environmental-effects-particulate-matter-pm).

### Volatile Organic Compounds

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are compounds that have a high vapor pressure and low water solubility. Many of these VOCs are made by humans. They are chemicals that are used and produced in the manufacture of paints, pharmeceuticals, and refrigerants. VOCs are usually industrial solvants, such as *trichlorothylene*, *fuel oxygenates* (e.g. MTBE); or they are by-products produced by chlorination in water treatment, such as chloroform. They are  also often a part of petroleum fuels, hydraulic fluids, pain thinners, and dry cleaning agents. VOCs are common ground-water contaminents as well, but AirNet will **not** be covering water related matter.

### Nitrogen Dioxide

Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a reddish-brown gas that is soluble in water, and is a strong oxidant. Common sources of this gas come from high temperature combustion of fuels in processes like heating, transportation, and power generation. Household sources of nitrogen oxides (NOx) include equipment that burns fuel like furnaces, fireplaces and gas ovens. Exposure to NO2 can cause irritation in the airways and aggressive respiratory diseases.  
NO2 is an important ozone precursor, a pollutant closely linked to asthma and other respiratory conditions.

You can find out more about NO2 [here](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/resources/nitrogen-dioxide-and-health)

### Ozone

Ozone (O3) is a major  component of smog (smoke fog). It is formed from photochemical reactions with pollutants such as VOCs, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides emmited from vehicles, and industry. It is most predominantly seen during periods of sunne weather, due to its photochemical nature. Ozone can also be generated by household equipment such as portable air cleaners.  
Exposure to **exessive** amounts of ozone can lead to breathing problems, trigger asthma, reduce lung function, and lung disease.

You can find out more about O3 [here](https://www.epa.gov/ground-level-ozone-pollution)

### Carbon Monoxide

Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odourless gas created by the incomplete combustion of carbonaceous fuels such as wood, petrol, coal, natural gas, and kerosene, usually burned in stoves, open fires, wick lamps, furnaces, et cetera. The most predominant source of CO in ambiant air is from fuel combustion in motor vehicles.  
CO diffuses across the lung tissues and into the bloodstream, making it difficult for the body's cells to bind to oxygen. The lack of oxygen can lead to the deteriation of cells. Symptoms of carbon monoxide exposure include but are not limited to: exhaustion, dizziness, difficulty breathing, et cetera. Exposure to high levels of this gas can be deadly.

## Sources of Air Pollution

### Main Sources of:

- PM2.5 are combustion engines, industrial emissions, residential heating, agricultural burning, and secondary formation.
- PM10 are construction sites, unpaved roads, tire wear, agricultural activities, pollen and mold spores, and wind-blown dust.
- VOCs are vehicle exhaust, solvants, industrial processes, household producs, gasoline storage and distribution, and natural sources (e.g. vegitation -- isoprene and terpenes).
- NO2 are traffic emissions, power plants, industrial combustion, and gas stoves and heaters (indoors).
- O3 (ground-level -- not emitted directly - forms through photochemical reactions) are NOx + VOCs + sunlight --> O3, vehicle emissions, industrial facilities, gasoline vapors, and natural VOC emissions under hot, sunny conditions.
- CO are motor vehicles, residentail heating (gas/wood), industrial processes, cigarette smoke (especially indoors) and wildfires.

## Health and environmental effects

### Main Health Effects of:

- PM2.5 are increased risk of heart attacks, strokes, asthma, lung cancer, and respiratory infections.
- PM10 are aggravation of asthma, bronchitis, and other lung conditions; can cause eye and throat irritation and reduce lung function.
- VOCs are when exposed for long enough: damage to liver, kidneys, and the CNS; some VOCs can cause cancer (carcinogenic).
- NO2 are lung irritation and reduced lung fucntion (especially in asthmatic children), increased risk of repiratory infection, can worsen cardiopulmonary diseases.
- O3 are chest pain, coughing, shortness of breath, lung inflammation, aggavation of asthma, prolonged exposure: permanent lung damage.
- CO are reduction of oxygen delivery to organs, fatigue, confusion, dizziness, chest pain, particularly dangerous for infants, pregnant women and people with heart disease.

### Main Environmental Effects of:

- PM2.5 are haze, deposits on surfaces, soil and water, altering nutrient balance; can damage crops and forests.
- PM10 are contribution to soil and water pollution, reduced crop yields, urban dust and grime.
- VOCs are precursors to ground-level ozone, contributes to the creation of some PM2.5s (secondary organic aerosols), can affect plant growth and forest health.
- NO2 are contribution to ozone and acid rain, eutrophication of water bodies, damages leafy plants.
- O3 are plant tissue damage, photosynthesis impairment, climate change contribution.
- CO indirect contribution to ground-level ozone formation, impact on urban air quality.

## Measurment techniques and sensor technologies

### How is PM measured?

Based on a blog on clarity.io, a company focused on air pollution monitoring, the instruments which most commonly are used for measuring PM do so either by measuring the **concentration** of particulate matter or the particle size distibution. The most accurate way to measure PM is using a "gravimeteric" method by drawing air into a filter where particles can colletct. This method also alows for a chemical analysis for research purpouses. 

Particulate matter can also be measured using optical instruments by looking at different properties of light (e.g. light scattering, absorption, and extinction) and how light reatcs with the presence of PM. The most popular is a so-called "OPC" -- short for optical particle counter -- which rapidly measures the amount of particles in a room (usually a cleanroom) by shining a light source, like a laser diode to illuminate the particles in front of a photodetector to measure the light scattered as a result of these particles.

### How are VOCs measured?

I found 3 main methods of measuring Volatile Organic Compounds:

- Photoionozation detector (PID)
- Flame ionization detector (FID)
- Metal oxide semi-conductor gas sensors (MOS)

I will explain what each of these devices do, but if you would like to learn about these sensors you can refer to these sources: [PID](https://www.gdscorp.com/blog/gas-detectors/measuring-voc-how-photoionization-detectors-work/), [FID](https://www.peakscientific.com/discover/news/how-does-an-fid-work/), [MOS](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3247717/) 

### Photoionization detector (PID)

PIDs can analyze a wide rang of chemicals, includign aromatic hydrocarbons, but they cannot analyze low molecular weight hydrocarbons. They work by using UV light to break down the airborn VOCs into either positive or negative ions. Once broken down, the device can measure or detect the change of the ionized gas. It is important to note that PID only temporarily breaks the VOCs sample down and detects them, but it does **not** permanently change them. An example of a dangerous VOC which PID can detect very well is methylene chloride.

### Flame ionization detector (FID)

FID is one of the most widely used detectors due to its low detection limits. In principle it works as solutes are swept through the component known as an "FID jet" as they elute at the end of the column. At the tip of this jet, the solutes pass through a flame made of a hydrogen/air mixture, which have to be provided via high-pressure tanks. As these organic solutes burn, they create ions which are then collected at electrodes called "collector plates". This creates a current in the detector's circuitry and this current eventually becomes the signal.

### Metal oxide semi-conductor gas sensors (MOS)

MOS sensors detect the presence of the harmful (or just targeted) gas by recording the changes in its (electrical) resistance of the sensing material. MOS sensors can be categorized into 2 types:

- n-type
- p-type

These 2 types differ in their construction and functionality. The further references will be in relation to the n-type sensor. The concept is that Oxygen particles in the atmosphere naturally stick to the surface of the MOS sensor, but reducing gases will seize O2 from the surface of the sensor, which in result releases electronsand **decreases** the electrical resistance within the sensor's ciruitry. This change is proportional to the concentration of the target gas and is measured by the sensor's electrodes.

### How is NO2 measured?

based on [clarity.io](https://www.clarity.io/blog/air-quality-measurements-series-nitrogen-dioxide), the primary method of measuring nitrogen dioxide is something called a "chemiliminescence continous analyzer". During this process, air is drawn in and nitrogen **monoxide** is made to react with ozone. This produces NO2 in a chemical reaction that also releases light. A computer can then be used to calculate the difference between the air born levels of nitrogen monoxide and other nitrogen oxides to find the level of nitrogen dioxide in the air.

### How is O3 measured?

A common tool used for measuring the amount of ozone in a room is a device called an "ozone analyzer". Something very good about this tool is that it measures the concentration of ozone in real-time. It uses a very interesting concept: due to ozone blocking light at wavelengths of approximately 254 nanometers -- the wave length of ultraviolet light -- the instrument can measure the intensity of light that passes through the air to determine the concentration of ozone present.

### How is CO measured?

One of the most common ways of detecting CO is with an instrument called the "electrochemical sensor". These devices operate by oxidizing carbon monoxide at an electrode, which in result generates an electric current proportional to the concentration of the gas. This sensor has high sensitivity and accuracy, low power consumption tare and a long lifespan all of which make this, one of the best methods to measure CO in the air.

It is also interesting to note that metal oxide semi-conductor sensors can also be used to measure the amount of CO in the air, although it is not as widely used as the electrochemical sensor.

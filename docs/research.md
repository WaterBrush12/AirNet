## An Overview of Air Pollution

Definition in the oxford dictionary:  
> The presence in or introcudtion into the air of a substance which has harmful or poisinous effects.

The "World Health Organization" (WHO) characterizes Air Pollution as the contamination of the indoor or outdoor entironment by any chemical, physical or biological agent that
modifies the natural characteristics of the atmosphese. This definition expands the original oxford explination by adding biohazards to the equation as well.  
They go on and provide us with some common examples which include but are not limited to: Household combustion devices, motor vehicles, industrial facilities and forest fires. Afterwards the major public health concern is clarified, which are: **particulate matter**, **carbon monoxide**, **ozone**, **nitrogen dioxide** and **sulfur dioxide**. Both outfoor and indoor air pollution can cause serious respiratory and other diseases.

WHO data also shows that almost (99%) of the global population is breathing air which exceeds [WHO guideline limits](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240034228) and there are high levels of pollutants present in our air. Another unfortunate aspect is that low- and middle-income countries are suffering the most and have the highest exposoures.

The air quality is also very closely linked to earth's ever-warming climate, due to many of the drivers of air pollution, for example the combustion of fossil fuels, are also huge sources of greenhouse gas emissions.

AirNet will be focusing on the indoor aspect of air pollution and will be presenting ideas and prototypes to reduce the pollutants in our air. AirNet will also have a critical focus on the financial aspect of filtering the air so that executing the idea in low- and middle-income countries will be even more attractive to their governments.
